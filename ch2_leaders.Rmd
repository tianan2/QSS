## Create a new binary variable named success that is equal to 1 if a leader dies from the attack and 0 if the leader survives. Store this new variable as part of the original data frame. What is the overall success rate of leader assassination. Does the result speak to the validity of the assumption that the success of assasination attempts is randomly determined?

df %>% mutate(success = if_else(str_detect(result, pattern = "dies"), 
                                true = 1, false = 0)) %>% 
  summarize(success_rate = mean(success))

## Investigate whether the average polity score over three years prior to an assassination attempt differs on average between successful and failed attempts.
